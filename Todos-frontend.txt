#setup logout feature by deleting the JWT from client's system

#in case of profile update, if user changes something that is present in JWT, delete the old JWT and provide a new one, also if JWT older than a month, just delete it and ask for sign in again.

for uploading avatars, use this
    <form action="http://localhost:3000/api/editUser" method="put" enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <input type="file" name="avatar" />
        <input type="submit">
    </form>

NOTE: don't forget to update JWT after profile edit, it contains name and avatar as well

store complete user data on client side, most importantly upvoted post array
